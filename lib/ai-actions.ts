You are an expert marketing funnel strategist. Your task is to create a branching chatbot conversation flow in a hierarchical JSON format based on the following rules and resources.

---
### CORE CONCEPTS

1.  **STAGES**: These represent the major vertical steps of the funnel (e.g., WELCOME, QUALIFICATION, OFFER). Each stage is a distinct layer.
2.  **ITEMS (BLOCKS)**: These are the individual chat messages within a Stage. A stage can have one or more items.

---
### ITEM MESSAGE CONSTRUCTION

**1. FOR ITEMS WITH CHOICES (items in any stage except 'OFFER'):**
The 'message' string must be structured exactly like this:
- **Line 1**: A short, impactful headline.
- **Line 2**: An empty line for spacing.
- **Line 3**: The instruction: "Answer by pasting one of those numbers".

*Example Message with Choices:*
"What's your main goal?

Answer by pasting one of those numbers"

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT include the numbered options in the message text. The options are already defined in the 'options' array and will be displayed separately by the UI.

**2. FOR ITEMS WITH AN OFFER (items in the 'OFFER' stage):**
The 'message' string must be a compelling sales message. Use emojis to make it engaging. It must follow this structure:
- **Opening**: A congratulatory message.
- **Recommendations Headline**: Something like "✨ Your Tailored Recommendations ✨".
- **Resource Details**: For each recommended resource, include:
    - ✅ The resource name.
    - The resource link.
    -️ The promo code, if available.
- **Closing**: An encouraging call to action with a sense of urgency.

*Example Offer Message:*
" Excellent! Based on your selections, here are some highly recommended resources:

✨ Your Tailored Recommendations ✨

✅ Beginner Dropshipping Course:
 [https://example.com/ds-beg](https://example.com/ds-beg)
️ Promo Code: SAVE10 (Limited Time Only!)

 Your Solution Awaits!
Don't miss out on these valuable resources. Act fast – this promo code is for a limited time only! ⏳"

---
### FUNNEL GENERATION RULES

1.  **RESOURCES**: You will be provided with a list of resources, categorized as either 'Free Value' or 'Paid Product'.
    ${resourceList}

2.  **GOAL**: Create a branching chatbot flow that qualifies users and directs them to the most suitable resource from the list.

3.  **HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE**: The funnel must be structured into the SAME logical STAGES for all users, regardless of their choices. A typical structure would be: WELCOME -> NICHE -> EXPERIENCE -> PAIN_POINT -> OFFER. All paths must go through these stages in this exact order.

4.  **STAGE-TO-STAGE TRANSITIONS**: An item's 'nextBlockId' MUST point to an item in the immediately following stage. No skipping stages.

5.  **BRANCHING WITHIN STAGES**:
    * The **WELCOME** stage will have one block with options that lead to different blocks in the **NICHE** stage.
    * The **NICHE** stage can have multiple blocks. The options in these blocks will lead to different blocks in the **EXPERIENCE** stage.
    * This branching continues through the qualification stages. The goal is to create different paths based on user answers.
    * The **OFFER** stage will contain multiple, unique offer blocks—one for each resource. The path a user takes through the qualification stages will determine which final offer block they see.

6.  **UNIQUE ENDPOINTS**: Each path through the funnel must end at a different block in the final **OFFER** stage. Two different qualification paths cannot lead to the same offer.

7.  **ESCAPE HATCH (CRITICAL RULE)**: The very first block in the 'WELCOME' stage **MUST** include an option like 'Just exploring for now.' or 'Skip for now'. This option's \`nextBlockId\` must be \`null\`.

8.  **VALUE-FIRST APPROACH**: Your primary goal is to guide users to a relevant 'Free Value' resource first. If a path leads to a 'Paid Product', try to also include a related 'Free Value' resource in the same offer message to maximize helpfulness.

### JSON OUTPUT STRUCTURE

Generate a clean, raw JSON object. Do not wrap it in markdown. The JSON must have three top-level keys: 'startBlockId', 'stages', and 'blocks'.

Here is a detailed example of the correct, required JSON structure:
\`\`\`json
{
  "startBlockId": "welcome_1",
  "stages": [
    {
      "id": "stage-welcome",

      "blockIds": [
        "welcome_1"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "stage-niche",
      "name": "NICHE",
      "explanation": "Determine the user's business niche.",
      "blockIds": [
        "niche_ds",
        "niche_smma"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "stage-offer",
      "name": "OFFER",
      "explanation": "Present the tailored resource.",
      "blockIds": [
        "offer_ds_final",
        "offer_smma_final"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "blocks": {
    "welcome_1": {
