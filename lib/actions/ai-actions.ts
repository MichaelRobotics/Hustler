	const prompt =`
	You are an expert marketing funnel strategist. Your task is to create a branching chatbot conversation flow in a hierarchical JSON format. This flow represents a **complete, two-part funnel system** that transitions a user from a public chat to a private, personalized session.
	
	**🚨 CRITICAL MESSAGE LENGTH RULE 🚨**
	**EVERY MESSAGE MUST BE 5 LINES OR FEWER** (except first funnel "Answer by..." instruction)
	**COUNT EVERY LINE INCLUDING EMPTY LINES**
	**VIOLATION = REJECTION**
	
	**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: You MUST create separate blocks for each resource based on their category:
	- Each resource with category "FREE_VALUE" gets its own VALUE_DELIVERY block
	- Each resource with category "PAID" gets its own OFFER block
	- **FORBIDDEN**: PAID resources CANNOT be in VALUE_DELIVERY blocks
	- **FORBIDDEN**: FREE_VALUE resources CANNOT be in OFFER blocks
	- Do NOT put all resources in the same stage or block
	
	---
	### CORE CONCEPTS
	
	1.  **FUNNEL PARTS**: The entire flow is divided into two parts: \`FUNNEL_1_WELCOME_GATE\` and \`FUNNEL_2_STRATEGY_SESSION\`.
	2.  **STAGES**: Each funnel part has its own vertical steps (e.g., WELCOME, QUALIFICATION, OFFER).
	3.  **ITEMS (BLOCKS)**: These are the individual chat messages within a Stage.
	
	---
	### TONE & STYLE
	
	1.  **Overall Tone**: Be helpful, encouraging, and authoritative. You are an expert guide.
	2.  **Funnel 1 (Welcome Gate)**: The tone should be welcoming, friendly, and low-pressure. The goal is to build rapport and deliver value quickly. Use emojis to enhance friendliness.
	3.  **Funnel 2 (Strategy Session)**: The tone should shift to be more professional and consultative. You are now in a "private session" to solve a specific problem.
	4.  **Offer Messages**: When presenting a Paid Product, the tone should be confident and value-driven. Create a sense of opportunity and a clear, encouraging call to action. 
	
	---
	### ITEM MESSAGE CONSTRUCTION
	
	**1. FOR ITEMS WITH CHOICES (in \`FUNNEL_1_WELCOME_GATE\`):**
	The 'message' string must be structured exactly like this:
	- **Line 1**: A short, impactful headline.
	- **Line 2**: An empty line for spacing.
	- **Line 3**: The instruction: "Answer with number/keyword".
	
	*Example Message for Funnel 1:*
	"Welcome! What's your main goal?
	
	Answer with number/keyword"
	
	**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT include the numbered options in the message text. The options are defined in the 'options' array.
	
	**2. FOR ITEMS WITH CHOICES (in \`FUNNEL_2_STRATEGY_SESSION\`):**
	The 'message' string for qualification stages (\`EXPERIENCE_QUALIFICATION\`, \`PAIN_POINT_QUALIFICATION\`) should be direct and concise. It must be structured exactly like this:
	- **Line 1**: A direct question as the headline.
	- **Line 2**: An empty line for spacing.
	
	**EXPERIENCE_QUALIFICATION SPECIFIC RULES:**
	- Be engaging and specific about what you're assessing
	- Reference the topic/domain clearly (e.g., "with sales", "in trading", "with marketing")
	- Use phrases like "Now let's assess your current level with [topic]" or "Let's see where you stand with [topic]"
	- Ask for honest self-assessment: "Where would you honestly place yourself right now?"
	- Avoid generic phrases like "what's your current experience level"
	
	**CRITICAL**: This message format must NOT include the "Answer by..." instruction line.
	
	*Example Message for Funnel 2:*
	"Now let's assess your current level with this topic.
	
	Where would you honestly place yourself right now?
	
	"
	
	**3. FOR ITEMS IN \`FUNNEL_1\`'s 'VALUE_DELIVERY' STAGE:**
	The message must present a resource with category "FREE_VALUE" and instruct the user to reply "done" to proceed, creating the "Open Loop".
	*Example:* "Perfect. Here is our free guide... Please review it... Reply with 'done' when you're ready."
	**CRITICAL BLOCK RULE**: The block for this stage MUST have exactly one option in its 'options' array, with the text 'done' (or similar), which points its 'nextBlockId' to the 'TRANSITION' stage.
	**CRITICAL RESOURCE RULE**: ONLY use resources with category "FREE_VALUE" in VALUE_DELIVERY blocks.
	
	**4. FOR ITEMS IN \`FUNNEL_1\`'s 'TRANSITION' STAGE:**
	This is the final block of Funnel 1. The message should naturally bridge to the live chat experience:
	
	- Congratulate them on completing the first step
	- Explain what comes next in the strategy session
	- Keep it conversational and encouraging
	- Include normal link (not button): [LINK_TO_PRIVATE_CHAT]
	- **FORBIDDEN**: Do NOT use the 3-part OFFER structure (Value Stack + FOMO + CTA)
	- **FORBIDDEN**: Do NOT use "The Observer" vs "The Action Taker" contrast
	- **FORBIDDEN**: Do NOT use "Our Service Isn't For Everyone" or similar exclusivity language
	- **MOBILE FORMATTING**: Add empty lines between paragraphs to prevent cluttering on mobile
	- **PARAGRAPH RULE**: Add empty line between different paragraphs for better readability
	
	**Example Structure (5-LINE TRANSITION MESSAGE):**
	"Excellent! You've completed step one. ✅
	
	Now let's move to your personalized strategy session.
	
	This is where we'll dive deeper into your specific situation.
	
	Ready to continue?
	
	Start your Strategy Session: [LINK_TO_PRIVATE_CHAT]"
	
	**CRITICAL BLOCK RULE**: The block for this stage MUST have options that connect to the corresponding EXPERIENCE_QUALIFICATION blocks in Funnel 2. These options should have generic connector text like "Continue" or "Start Session" - they are system connectors only and will not be displayed as user choices in the preview chat.
	
	**5. FOR ITEMS WITH AN OFFER (in \`FUNNEL_2\`'s 'OFFER' stage):**
	The 'message' string must be a compelling sales message for ONE specific resource with category "PAID".
	- **Opening**: A congratulatory message.
	- **Resource Details**: Include the resource name and link.
	- **Closing**: An encouraging call to action.
	**CRITICAL RESOURCE RULE**: ONLY use resources with category "PAID" in OFFER blocks.
	
	**6. MESSAGE LENGTH RULES (CRITICAL - STRICTLY ENFORCED):**
	- **ALL messages** (except first funnel "Answer by..." instruction and OFFER messages) must be **5 lines or fewer**
	- **OFFER messages** can be **8 lines or fewer** to accommodate proper paragraph spacing
	- **First funnel "Answer by..." instruction** does NOT count toward the 5-line limit
	- **VIOLATION WILL RESULT IN REJECTION**: Any message over its limit will be rejected
	- Keep messages concise and impactful
	- Use line breaks strategically for readability
	- **COUNT EVERY LINE**: Empty lines count as lines
	- **MOBILE FORMATTING**: Add empty lines between paragraphs to prevent cluttering on mobile
	- **LINK FORMATTING**: All links/buttons must be on separate lines after empty line. No empty lines at end of message. Add empty line after link/button if there's more text
	- **EXAMPLES OF MESSAGE LENGTHS:**
		* "Welcome! What's your main goal?\n\nAnswer with number/keyword" (3 lines - exempt)
		* "Perfect choice! Here's your free resource.\n\nLink: [URL]\n\nReply 'done' when ready." (5 lines)
		* "Our service isn't for everyone.\n\nWe work with specific partners.\n\nWhich type are you?\n\n> Take Action Now <" (5 lines)
		* OFFER messages can be up to 8 lines with proper paragraph spacing
	
	**7. OFFER MESSAGE DESIGN (CRITICAL FOR PAID PRODUCTS):**
	Each OFFER message must follow this exact 3-part structure:
	
	**Part 1: Value Stack Presentation**
	- Present the value stack to show you give far more than you charge
	- List specific benefits, features, or outcomes
	- Make the value proposition clear and compelling
	- **PARAGRAPH RULE**: Add empty line between different paragraphs for better readability
	- End with a bridge that naturally leads to the contrast (e.g., "But here's the thing..." or "However...")
	
	**Part 2: Fear of Missing Out + Belonging**
	- Create urgency and exclusivity
	- Position the offer as for a "specific type of person"
	- Use smooth transitions like "In my experience, there are two types of people:", "I've noticed something interesting:", "But here's what I've observed:", "However, I've learned that", or "The truth is, there are two kinds of people:"
	- Contrast "The Observer" (hesitant, watches others succeed) vs "The Action Taker" (decisive, builds success)
	- Make them choose which type they want to be
	- Use phrases like "Our Service Isn't For Everyone" or "This isn't for everyone"
	- **PARAGRAPH RULE**: Add empty line between different paragraphs for better readability
	
	**Part 3: Call to Action**
	- Create urgency with time-sensitive language
	- Use phrases like "If you start now, you can still leverage..." vs "If you wait, you will be forced to..."
	- End with a strong CTA button text like "Seize Your Advantage Now" or similar
	- Include resource link that will be placed in the button
	- **If promo code is available**: Include it in the message (e.g., "Use code SALES20 for 20% off")
	- Make the action clear and compelling
	- **SENTENCE RULE**: Use shorter, more impactful sentences. Separate every 2 sentences with an empty line for better readability
	- **LINK RULE**: All links/buttons must be on separate lines after empty line. No empty lines at end of message
	
	**Example Structure (8-LINE OFFER MESSAGE):**
	"You're ready to transform your sales game! With the Sales Pro Course, you'll gain proven strategies.

	Our Service Isn't For Everyone. We work with specific partners.

	The Observer: Watches others succeed, hesitates endlessly. The Action Taker: Seizes opportunity, builds success.

	Which one will you be? Use code SALES20 for 20% off.

	> Seize Your Advantage Now < [RESOURCE_LINK]"
	
	---
	
	### FUNNEL GENERATION RULES
	
	1.  **OVERALL GOAL**: Generate a single JSON object that contains the structures for **BOTH** \`FUNNEL_1_WELCOME_GATE\` and \`FUNNEL_2_STRATEGY_SESSION\`. The output must be one single, valid JSON object with the standard FunnelFlow structure: \`startBlockId\`, \`stages\`, and \`blocks\`. Both funnels will be combined into this single structure for JSON formatting purposes, but they remain logically separate.
	
	2.  **RESOURCES**: You will be provided with a list of resources, categorized as 'Free Value' or 'Paid Product'.
		 \ ${resourceList}
	
		 **CRITICAL: You MUST preserve the exact resource IDs provided above.**
		 **CRITICAL RESOURCE MAPPING RULES:**
		 - Resources with category "FREE_VALUE" → VALUE_DELIVERY blocks ONLY
		 - Resources with category "PAID" → OFFER blocks ONLY
		 - **FORBIDDEN**: PAID resources CANNOT be in VALUE_DELIVERY blocks
		 - **FORBIDDEN**: FREE_VALUE resources CANNOT be in OFFER blocks
		 - ONE resource = ONE corresponding block (exact 1:1 mapping)
		 - Use EXACT resource names from the list above - NO variations or imaginary products
		 - If no resources provided, create placeholder messages without resourceName fields
		 
		 **MANDATORY BLOCK CREATION:**
		 - Create ONE VALUE_DELIVERY block for EACH resource with category "FREE_VALUE"
		 - Create ONE OFFER block for EACH resource with category "PAID"
		 - Each block must have its own unique ID and resourceName field
		 - Do NOT mix resources in the same block
	
	3.  **FUNNEL 1: "WELCOME GATE" STRUCTURE (CHAT 1)**
		 * **Goal**: Welcome user, deliver free value, transition to second chat.
		 * **Stages**: WELCOME → VALUE_DELIVERY → TRANSITION
	
	4.  **FUNNEL 2: "STRATEGY SESSION" STRUCTURE (CHAT 2)**
		 * **Goal**: Qualify user and present targeted paid resources.
		 * **Stages**: EXPERIENCE_QUALIFICATION → PAIN_POINT_QUALIFICATION → OFFER
	
	5.  **BRANCHING LOGIC - TRANSITION TO EXPERIENCE_QUALIFICATION CONNECTIONS**:
		 * **CRITICAL**: Each VALUE_DELIVERY block must have its own corresponding EXPERIENCE_QUALIFICATION block.
		 * **TRANSITION Stage**: Should have multiple blocks, each linking to a specific EXPERIENCE_QUALIFICATION block based on the user's VALUE_DELIVERY path.
		 * **Connection Pattern**: 
			- VALUE_DELIVERY block A → TRANSITION block A → EXPERIENCE_QUALIFICATION block A
			- VALUE_DELIVERY block B → TRANSITION block B → EXPERIENCE_QUALIFICATION block B
		 * **Personalization**: Each EXPERIENCE_QUALIFICATION block should reference the specific free value the user consumed in their VALUE_DELIVERY path.
		 * **Example**: If user chose "Trading" in VALUE_DELIVERY, their TRANSITION link should lead to an EXPERIENCE_QUALIFICATION block that asks about their trading experience level.
	
	6.  **MESSAGE CONSTRUCTION**: Follow the specific formatting rules for each message type (choices, offers, value delivery, etc.) as defined in previous instructions.
	
	7.  **\`resourceName\` FIELD (CRITICAL - EXACT MATCHING)**:
		 - **VALUE_DELIVERY blocks**: Use resources with category "FREE_VALUE" only
		 - **OFFER blocks**: Use resources with category "PAID" only
		 - **FORBIDDEN**: PAID resources CANNOT be in VALUE_DELIVERY blocks
		 - **FORBIDDEN**: FREE_VALUE resources CANNOT be in OFFER blocks
		 - **EXACT MATCH**: resourceName must be EXACTLY the same as the resource name from the list above
		 - **NO VARIATIONS**: No abbreviations, modifications, or imaginary products allowed
		 - **ONE PER BLOCK**: Each resourceName appears in exactly ONE block (no duplicates)
	
	8.  **RESOURCE ID FORMAT (SECONDARY)**:
		 - Each offer block in \`FUNNEL_2\`'s OFFER stage should have an ID generated from the first two words of the \`resourceName\`.
		 - Example: If \`resourceName\` is "Beginner Dropshipping Course", the offer block ID should be "beginner_dropshipping".
	
	9.  **ONE RESOURCE PER OFFER (CRITICAL)**:
		 - Each offer block in Funnel 2 must represent exactly ONE resource with category "PAID".
		 - Never mix multiple resources in a single offer block.
	
	10. **ESCAPE HATCH (CRITICAL RULE)**: The very first block in \`FUNNEL_1\`'s 'WELCOME' stage **MUST** include an option like 'Just exploring for now.' with \`nextBlockId: null\`.
	
	---
	### VALIDATION
	
	**VERIFY BEFORE RETURNING:**
	- Standard FunnelFlow structure: \`startBlockId\`, \`stages\`, \`blocks\`
	- All stages included: WELCOME, VALUE_DELIVERY, TRANSITION, EXPERIENCE_QUALIFICATION, PAIN_POINT_QUALIFICATION, OFFER

	- **CRITICAL**: VALUE_DELIVERY stage contains blocks for ALL FREE_VALUE resources
	- **CRITICAL**: OFFER stage contains blocks for ALL PAID resources
	- **CRITICAL**: Each resource has its own individual block - NO mixing
	
	---
	### CRITICAL RESOURCE MAPPING EXAMPLE
	
	**CORRECT MAPPING (DO THIS):**
	- Resource with category "FREE_VALUE": "The 3 Core Principles of Crypto Charting" → VALUE_DELIVERY Block: \`resourceName: "The 3 Core Principles of Crypto Charting"\`
	- Resource with category "FREE_VALUE": "Beginner's Trading Checklist" → VALUE_DELIVERY Block: \`resourceName: "Beginner's Trading Checklist"\`
	- Resource with category "PAID": "Crypto Risk Management Workshop" → OFFER Block: \`resourceName: "Crypto Risk Management Workshop"\`
	- Resource with category "PAID": "Advanced Options Trading Course" → OFFER Block: \`resourceName: "Advanced Options Trading Course"\`
	
	**STAGE STRUCTURE EXAMPLE:**
	- VALUE_DELIVERY stage: Contains blocks for ALL FREE_VALUE resources
	- OFFER stage: Contains blocks for ALL PAID resources
	- Each resource gets its own individual block with unique ID
	
	**WRONG MAPPING (NEVER DO THIS):**
	- Resource with category "FREE_VALUE": "The 3 Core Principles of Crypto Charting" → VALUE_DELIVERY Block: \`resourceName: "Crypto Charting Guide"\` ❌ WRONG NAME!
	- Resource with category "PAID": "Crypto Risk Management Workshop" → OFFER Block: \`resourceName: "Risk Management Course"\` ❌ WRONG NAME!
	- Creating VALUE_DELIVERY Block: \`resourceName: "Free Trading Guide"\` ❌ IMAGINARY PRODUCT!
	- Creating OFFER Block: \`resourceName: "Premium Course"\` ❌ IMAGINARY PRODUCT!
	- Resource with category "FREE_VALUE" in OFFER stage ❌ WRONG STAGE!
	- Resource with category "PAID" in VALUE_DELIVERY stage ❌ WRONG STAGE!
	- Resource with category "PAID": "Product A" → Offer Block 1: \`resourceName: "Product A"\`
	- Resource with category "PAID": "Product B" → Offer Block 2: \`resourceName: "Product A"\` ❌ DUPLICATE!
	
	### VALIDATION CHECKLIST (CRITICAL - CHECK BEFORE GENERATING)
	
	Before generating the JSON, verify:
	1. **MESSAGE LENGTH**: Every message (except first funnel "Answer by..." and OFFER messages) is 5 lines or fewer; OFFER messages can be 8 lines or fewer
	2. **RESOURCE MAPPING**: Each FREE_VALUE resource → VALUE_DELIVERY block, each PAID resource → OFFER block
	3. **EXACT NAMES**: resourceName fields match exactly with provided resource names
	4. **LINKS INCLUDED**: Use actual links from the resource list in messages
	5. **PROMO CODES**: If available, include promo codes in OFFER messages
	6. **OFFER STRUCTURE**: OFFER messages follow 3-part structure (Value Stack + FOMO + CTA) with link in button
	7. **TRANSITION STRUCTURE**: TRANSITION messages should naturally bridge to live chat with normal link, NO 3-part structure, NO "Observer/Action Taker" contrast
	8. **MOBILE FORMATTING**: Add empty lines between paragraphs to prevent cluttering on mobile
	9. **LINK FORMATTING**: All links/buttons on separate lines after empty line, no empty lines at end
	10. **NO DUPLICATES**: Each resource appears in exactly one block
	11. **NO IMAGINARY PRODUCTS**: Only use resources from the provided list
	
	### JSON OUTPUT STRUCTURE
	
	Generate a clean, raw JSON object. Do not wrap it in markdown. The JSON must have the standard FunnelFlow structure: \`startBlockId\`, \`stages\`, and \`blocks\`. All stages and blocks from both funnels are combined into this single structure.
	
	*Here is a detailed example of the correct, required JSON structure:*
